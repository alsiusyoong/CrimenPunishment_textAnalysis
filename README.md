# Crime and Punishment: Text Analytics
I had just finished reading Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky and I wanted to do a text analysis on each character. I wanted to investigate how many times a character is mentioned in each chapter. To pay tribute to the book, I also represent the book in a visual way.

# Introduction
There are a number of characters in the book. Rodion Raskolnikov, a former law student is plagued by poverty. In St Petersburg, he lives in the slums and relies on his family for money. He wrestles with the theory of the Übermensch, and commits a cold-blooded murder. He descends into madness as he tries to outsmart the law. Sonya, a girl forced into prostitution becomes his only source of redemption. Raskolnikov’s sister, Dunya, is similar to her brother, but she is moral and compassionate. Porfiry Petrovich is Raskolnikov’s main antagonist, a magistrate in charge of investigating the murders. These were the characters that I wanted to focus on as I felt that they were the most important in the novel.

# Visualization
My main goal was to **share my passion for the novel and have something to remember it by.**
Based on the plot, I wanted to see if there was any significance of the frequency of characters being mentioned. I also wanted to visualize the number of words in each chapter, in each part.
